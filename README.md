# PowerBI-CaseStudy-1: Bigfoot Sightings

## Abstract
This report examines the patterns in Bigfoot sightings across various states and seasons, using data recorded from 1980 to 2021. The visualizations developed from this dataset are intended to provide insights into sighting trends and to help hypothesize about the factors influencing these occurrences.

## Data Analysis

### Trends Over Time
The bar and line chart exhibits the number of Bigfoot sightings over the years, with a notable peak in reports occurring in the late 2000s. The decline in sightings after this peak could indicate changes in public interest or the reporting habits rather than a decline in actual sightings.

### Sighting Distribution by Latitude
The classifications based on latitude—North, Central, Far North—reveal an interesting spread of sightings. The 'avg latitude' line could indicate the average latitude where sightings are reported, offering a geographical context to the data.

### State and Seasonal Distribution
The horizontal bar chart presents the total sightings by state and season, illustrating that Washington is the leading state for reports, with most sightings occurring in the fall. This may suggest environmental factors or seasonal behaviors of wildlife that could be mistaken for Bigfoot.

### Quarterly and Monthly Sightings
The treemap shows sightings by quarter and month, with the later months of the year, particularly October, having higher numbers. July also stands out as a month with a significant number of reports.

## Discussion
The visualization suggests that sightings are more frequent in the northern latitudes of the United States, with a seasonal bias towards the fall and summer months. The data could be indicative of the reporting behavior influenced by outdoor activities prevalent during these seasons.

## Future Directions
Further research could investigate the correlation between sightings and factors such as population density, proximity to forests, and outdoor recreational activity levels. Additionally, analyzing the influence of media, including the release of films and television shows about Bigfoot, on the frequency of sightings reported could provide valuable insights into the data trends observed.

## Conclusion
This visualization-based analysis provides an overview of the reported Bigfoot sightings and posits potential factors that may affect these reports. While the data offers a quantitative look at when and where sightings occur, qualitative research is necessary to understand the causative factors behind these patterns.
